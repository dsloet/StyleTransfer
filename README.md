# Neural Style Transfer

Using Keras or TensorFlow to perform style transfer on images.

This repo is used for a hackathon. To use this repo effectively, download the .ipynb files under style_keras or style_tf.

Navigate to colab.research.google.com and upload the notebooks (.ipynb). make sure your runtime session is using a GPU (under Runtime > change runtime type. Set Hardware accelerator to GPU)

optionally, to run locally:
- Create a new environment with python 3.6.5 ('$ conda create --name <name> python=3.6.5')
- Activate your new environment ('$ conda activate <name>')
- from your cli '$ pip install -r requirements.txt'
